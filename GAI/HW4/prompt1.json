{"prompt": "You are a math expert. I will provide you some math problems, and it will be your job to solve them step by step and correctly.\n\nHere are some example questions and solutions:\n\nQ: A gardener is planting flowers in a pattern: two red flowers followed by one yellow flower. If the gardener wants to maintain this pattern and has 35 spaces in a row to fill, how many red flowers will the gardener plant?\nProblem-solving Process:\n\n1.  Find the total number of groups of three flowers.\n35 \u00f7 3 = 11 groups of 3 flowers + 2 flowers left over\n\n2. There are always two red flowers in each group.\n11 x 2 = 22 red flowers\n\n3. Add the two extra left over flowers.\n22 + 2 = 24 red flowers\nA: 24\n\nQ: Dr. Wilson is planting a geometric garden with flowers arranged in concentric rings around a central fountain. Each outer ring has 6 more flowers than the inner one, forming a hexagonal pattern. The innermost ring has 6 flowers. If Dr. Wilson plants enough flowers to form 15 rings, including the innermost ring, what is the total number of flowers needed for the garden?\nProblem-solving Process:\n\n**Problem-Solving Process**\n\nStep 1: Determine the increase in flowers for each outer ring.\n6 more flowers per ring\n\nStep 2: Find the number of flowers in the 2nd ring.\n6 + 6 = 12 flowers\n\nStep 3: Since each outer ring has 6 more flowers than the previous ring, we can create a simple formula for the number of flowers in ring \"n\":   \nStarting with 6 flowers in the 1st ring, each outer ring has 6 more flowers than the previous ring. So we represent this as:\nRing 1: 6 flowers \nRing 2: 6+6 =12 flowers\nRing 3: 12+6=18flowers\nRing n:(6+6(n-1))flowers. \n\nStep 4: We know that there are 15 rings in total, so we can sum up the number of flowers in each ring using the formula from step 3:\n\nSum of flowers in 15 rings = 6 + (6+6(2)) + (6+6(3)) + ... + (6+6(14))\n\nStep 5: Simplify the expression:\n\n= 6 + 12 + 18 + 24 + ... + 90\n= 6(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 15)    (Factoring out constants)\n= 6 * [(15) * (16) / 2] (Sum of an arithmetic series)\n= 90 * 8\n= 720\n\n**Recheck Answer:**\n\nTo check if our answer is correct, we can calculate the total number of flowers by adding up the flowers in each ring manually:\n\nRing 1: 6 flowers\nRing 2: 12 flowers\nRing 3: 18 flowers\nRing 4: 24 flowers\n...\nRing 15: 90 flowers\n\nTotal: 6 + 12 + 18 + 24 + ... + 90 = 720 flowers\n\n**Conclusion:** Our answer of 720 flowers is correct.\n\n**Answer: 720**\nA: 720\n\n\nPlease list all the steps you calculate in your mind. After all process of calculation, recheck the answer. Put the answer into the problem statement and check if it is correct. If the answer is incorrect, try to use another solution to solve it again. Also, don\u2019t round your answer if the question hasn\u2019t mentioned you to do so, just output the original answer. This is very important to both you and my life, please solve it perfectly. Output the answer at last.\n\nProblem: {{question}}\n\nAnswer:\n"}
