{"prompt": "You are a math expert. I will provide you some math problems, and it will be your job to solve them step by step and correctly.\n\nHere are some example questions and solutions:\n\nQ: A gardener is planting flowers in a pattern: two red flowers followed by one yellow flower. If the gardener wants to maintain this pattern and has 35 spaces in a row to fill, how many red flowers will the gardener plant?\nProblem-solving Process:\n\n1.  Find the total number of groups of three flowers.\n35 \u00f7 3 = 11 groups of 3 flowers + 2 flowers left over\n\n2. There are always two red flowers in each group.\n11 x 2 = 22 red flowers\n\n3. Add the two extra left over flowers.\n22 + 2 = 24 red flowers\nA: 24\n\nQ: A garden has rectangular plots arranged in such a way that each plot shares sides with exactly two other plots, forming a straight line. There are 5 plots in total. Each of the middle plots has an area of 24 square meters, and the width of the plots is 4 meters. The width remains constant for all plots. The first plot in the line is twice as long as a middle plot, and the last plot is half as long as a middle plot. What is the total area of all the plots combined?\nProblem-solving Process:\n\n**Step 1: Find the length of each middle plot.**\n\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width\n\n24 = Length \u00d7 4\n\nLength = 6 meters\n\n**Step 2: Find the length of the first plot.**\n\nThe first plot is twice as long as a middle plot.\n\nLength of first plot = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 meters\n\n**Step 3: Find the length of the last plot.**\n\nThe last plot is half as long as a middle plot.\n\nLength of last plot = 6 / 2 = 3 meters\n\n**Step 4: Find the total area of all the plots.**\n\nTotal area = Area of first plot + Area of middle plots + Area of last plot\n\nTotal area = (12 \u00d7 4) + (6 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2) + (3 \u00d7 4)\n\n**Total area = 132 square meters**\n\n**Recheck the answer:**\n\nPlot 1: 12 \u00d7 4 = 48 sq m\nPlot 2: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 sq m\nPlot 3: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 sq m\nPlot 4: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 sq m\nPlot 5: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 sq m\nTotal: 48 + 24 + 24 + 24 + 12 = 132 sq m\nThe answer is correct.\nA: 132\n\nQ: Jason is training for a marathon and runs a certain distance each day. On Monday, he runs 5 miles. Each day after, he increases his distance by 10%. If Jason continues this pattern, how many miles will he run on Friday?\nProblem-solving Process:\n\n1. Calculate the distance on Tuesday: \nDistance on Monday = 5 miles\nIncrease by 10% on Tuesday = 5 miles x 110% = 5.5 miles\n2. Calculate the distance on Wednesday:\nDistance on Tuesday = 5.5 miles\nIncrease by 10% on Wednesday = 5.5 miles x 110% = 6.05 miles\n3. Calculate the distance on Thursday:\nDistance on Wednesday = 6.05 miles\nIncrease by 10% on Thursday = 6.05 miles x 110% = 6.655 miles\n4. Calculate the distance on Friday:\nDistance on Thursday = 6.655 miles\nIncrease by 10% on Friday = 6.655 miles x 110% = 7.3205 miles\nA: 7.3205\n\n\nPlease list all the steps you calculate in your mind. After all process of calculation, recheck the answer. Put the answer into the problem statement and check if it is correct. If the answer is incorrect, try to use another solution to solve it again. Also, don\u2019t round your answer if the question hasn\u2019t mentioned you to do so, just output the original answer. This is very important to both you and my life, please solve it perfectly. Output the answer at last.\n\nProblem: {{question}}\n\nAnswer:\n"}
